# V.8 Monitoring and Anomaly Detection

## Control Objective
Continuously monitor the use of LLM-powered applications to detect anomalous behavior or outputs that could indicate security incidents or system misuse.

| # | Requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| - | ---------- | -- | -- | -- |
| 8.1 | Continuously monitor the usage patterns of LLM applications for anomalies that could indicate security incidents, such as unexpected spikes in usage or deviations from typical output patterns. |      | ✓ | ✓ |
| 8.2 | Establish logging and alerting mechanisms for events that could suggest prompt leaks, such as the appearance of canary tokens (see 5.1.6) in logs or unexpected language patterns. |      | ✓ | ✓ |
| 8.3 | Define baselines for normal LLM interactions and monitor and alert when abnormal LLM interactions are detected. |      |      | ✓ |
